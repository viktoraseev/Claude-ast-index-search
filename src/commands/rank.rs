//! Ranking presets for `search --rank`.
//!
//! A preset re-orders what a query already found; it never adds or drops a
//! match. The candidate pool is the head of the ordinary relevance order
//! (project code only), and relevance keeps its say on top of the score:
//!
//! * **Symbol tiers are hard.** A symbol whose name is exactly what was typed
//!   stays above one whose name merely contains it, which stays above one
//!   that only mentions it in its signature. A preset only re-orders inside a
//!   tier, so `search User --rank central` cannot answer with some unrelated
//!   base class that happens to be more central.
//! * **Position still counts inside a tier.** The final key is a weighted
//!   blend of the preset score and the candidate's relevance position within
//!   its tier, so the tail of the pool needs a clearly better score to
//!   overtake its head.
//! * **Files** all contain the query in their path; where it sits (file stem,
//!   file name, directory) is their relevance term, not a boundary.
//! * **Third-party code** (`db::is_vendor_path`) is never scored and is
//!   listed after every project result.
//!
//! Two kinds of evidence feed the scores, at different granularities:
//!
//! * **File history** (`hotspots --collect`): commits, bugfix ratio, churn,
//!   authors, age. It describes the whole file — every symbol defined in a
//!   file shares it — and is always labelled that way.
//! * **Symbol graph** (`graph build`): resolved fan-in, transitive dependents
//!   and PageRank of the symbol itself. For a file result, the file's
//!   strongest symbol (highest PageRank) stands in for the file.
//!
//! A preset whose evidence is missing is not applied at all, and the output
//! says which command collects it: ranking by zeros would look like a verdict.
